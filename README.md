Introduction

The app is targeted to solve the existing problem of networking and consequential deficit in personality and skill development that newcomers to a college/university face. This problem becomes a crisis when the aforementioned tasks are asked to be carried out amidst situations like a pandemic. By the medium of our app, we foster an environment, a community that builds a network, a platform of interaction between the mentors and mentees - where they can chat or video call each other and thus get holistically developed in whatever field they deem necessary.
